ILAB: Interactive LABeling
==========================

Collecting an Annotated Dataset with a Reduced Workload thanks to Active Learning

ILAB allows to acquire an annotated dataset to learn a supervised detection model with a low human effort.
It is an iterative process initialized with some annotated instances. Then, at each iteration the user is asked to annotate a few
instances to improve the current detection model.

.. code-block:: bash

    SecuML_ILAB <project> <dataset> <strategy>

For more information about the available options for a given active learning strategy:

.. code-block:: bash
